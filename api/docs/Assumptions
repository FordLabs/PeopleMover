Problems, Assumptions, and Hypotheses

## Structure:
- Assumption
    - Hypothesis


## Problem:
Allocation of people to products is inefficient
- Allocating people to products is too time consuming
  - If we make allocating people to products faster, we will spend less time wondering who goes where
- The current process is manual
  - If we automate the process, we will have fewer weekly meetings to discuss allocations, leading to greater efficiency
- The current allocations process takes a long time
  - Current observation: multiple meetings per week to discuss allocations
- We do not currently have an efficient process
  - Current observation: John mentioned spending ~10 minutes at the start of a meeting writing names on stickies
- The managers know the best process for allocating people to products
  - If we automate the managers’ current process, it can be consistently repeated.
- Labs has a consistent vision/service model across the product teams
  - If we ask all teams about the office vision, we will receive similar responses from every team

## Problem: 
Engineers/PMs/Designers do not have input on what products they end up on
AND people are unhappy with their product assignments
### Note:
“We” below is the royal “we” referring to the Labs as a collective.
- Allocations is a bigger problem than just management
  - TBD
- People cannot choose their product
  - Current observations: John’s admission that he didn’t ask JK about which product, and assumed anything would be good
- People are unhappy due to their product
  - If we allow people to have a more active role in choosing their product, then they will be happier
- People have reasonable expectations
  - TBD
- We can define and measure satisfaction
  - If we conduct a baseline and follow-up survey of happiness, we will see a pattern
- We know what makes a good product experience
  - TBD

## Problem:
There is no place to visualize who is assigned to which product
- Visualization helps with Allocation
  - If we provide a visual representation of allocations (as opposed to a spreadsheet), allocations meetings will take less time
- People want to know who is on which product
  - If we provide insight into product teams, there will be no confusion as to who is on which product

## Problem:
People are assigned to products for too long
- People want to move off of products
  - If we give people the opportunity to rotate to a new product, they will take it.
- We know what “too long” means
  - TBD

## Problem:
People are being assigned to teams where they aren’t equipped to succeed
- People know what success means (common definition across products)
  - See consistent vision assumption
- Moving products increases satisfaction
  - If a team member moves to a new product, their satisfaction and engagement with their product will increase.

## Problem:
It’s hard to retrieve data about previous product assignments
- Managers have data about previous assignments
  - If we ask managers about previous product assignments for an employee, we could locate it within 2 days
- Managers want data about previous assignments
  - If managers had data about previous product assignments, they would make different staffing decisions
